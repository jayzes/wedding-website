If you’re flying in from out-of-state, you have two primary airport options - Denver (DEN) and Eagle (EGE).  As with all things in life, there are pros and cons for each.

Flights into Denver are generally cheaper and more plentiful. However, you’ll need to arrange for transportation to Beaver Creek - a scenic 2.5 hour drive west on I-70. You can either rent a car at the airport or arrange for a shuttle to transport you to the mountains. We like [Colorado Mountain Express](https://www.coloradomountainexpress.com/){:target="blank"} should you choose the latter option, and we'll have a discount code available to book by mid-February. We suggest making arrangements as far in advance as your schedule allows.

Eagle’s airport is conveniently located only 30 minutes west of Beaver Creek. However, flights into Eagle are typically more expensive and schedules can be limited. You will still need a car or a shuttle to get to the resort.

If you are concerned about altitude, we suggest flying into Denver and spending
a night there first to help your body acclimatize.

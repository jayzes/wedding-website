If you’re flying in from out-of-state, you have two primary airport options - Denver (DEN) and Eagle (EGE).  As with all things in life, there are tradeoffs for each.

Flights into Denver are generally cheaper and more plentiful. However, you’ll need to arrange for transportation to Beaver Creek - roughly a 2.5 hour drive west on I-70. You can either rent a car at the airport or arrange for a shuttle. We like Colorado Mountain Express should you choose the latter option (link to site for booking). As with all things, we suggest making arrangements as far in advance as your schedule allows.

Eagle’s airport is conveniently located only 30 minutes west of Beaver Creek. However, flights into Eagle are typically more expensive and schedules can be limited. You will still need a car or a shuttle to get to the resort.

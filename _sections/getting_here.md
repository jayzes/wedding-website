If you’re flying in from out-of-state, you have two primary airport options - Denver (DEN) and Eagle (EGE).  As with all things in life, there are pros and cons for each.

Flights into Denver are generally cheaper and more plentiful. However, you’ll need to arrange for transportation to Beaver Creek - a scenic 2.5 hour drive west on I-70. You can either rent a car at the airport or arrange for a shuttle to transport you to the mountains. We like [Colorado Mountain Express](http://coloradomountainexpress.hudsonltd.net/res?USERIDENTRY=VBCWEDD1&LOGON=GO){:target="blank"} should you choose to go with a shuttle. We've arranged for a discounted rate; all you need to do is click and book through [this link](http://coloradomountainexpress.hudsonltd.net/res?USERIDENTRY=VBCWEDD1&LOGON=GO){:target="blank"}. We suggest making arrangements as far in advance as your schedule allows.

Eagle’s airport is conveniently located only 30 minutes west of Beaver Creek. However, flights into Eagle are typically more expensive and schedules can be limited. You will still need a car or a shuttle to get to the resort.

It is worth noting that traffic from Denver to the mountains has become
increasingly heavy during the summer months as more and more people discover the
magic of spending a summer weekend at high altitude. Please allow ample travel
time from Denver to Beaver Creek, especially if you plan to make the journey on
Friday afternoon or Saturday morning. Travel times are frequently much higher
during these peak periods and it's not unusual for the trip to take an extra
hour (or more). Similarly, eastbound traffic back to Denver begins to build
around lunchtime on Sunday and can continue to be heavy through the early
evening. Please plan accordingly for your trip back down the hill!

If you are concerned about altitude, we suggest flying into Denver and spending
a night there first to help your body acclimatize.

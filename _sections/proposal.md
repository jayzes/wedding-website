In October 2017, Jay suggested a weekend getaway to the mountains. We don’t normally venture up to the mountains during the “mud season,” but we were both in need of a mini vacation and were lured by the promise of early-season snowfall.

We ventured up to Piney Lake for a hike in the designated wilderness area. Jay noted a waterfall located a few miles up the mountain trail and we set off towards the peaks to find it. Marla chattered for most of the hike up about her winter running shoes and didn’t really notice Jay’s nerves.

When we reached our destination, we realized that the waterfall had already frozen over for the winter. As Marla looked around and began to comment on the scenery around them, Jay knelt on a rock outcropping overlooking the jagged Gore Range and asked Marla to be his forever adventure partner.

Please refer to our <a href="/#maps">maps</a> for directions, maps, and parking information for all of the weekend's festivities!

### Friday
Please join us Friday evening for a welcome reception at the Beaver Creek Club Mountain Clubhouse (NOT the golf course). More information may be found on the detail card in your invitation.

### Saturday
Our ceremony will take place at the Red Sky Ranch Member Clubhouse on July 21. Cocktails, dinner and dancing will follow immediately at the same location.

Red Sky Ranch is located about 25 minutes (15 miles) west of Beaver Creek. We will provide transportation from Centennial Station in Beaver Creek to Red Sky and then back to Beaver Creek at the end of the night. We will also run an early shuttle after dinner for anyone who needs it. **Please plan to board the shuttle at Centennial Station by 4:45 pm.**

Very limited parking is also available at Red Sky should you wish to drive yourself; however, trust us when we say that you don't want to drive yourself. We do request that you please plan to take the shuttle unless you absolutely must drive yourself, and especially if you are unfamiliar with mountain driving or if you wish to take advantage of the bar during the reception. We want everyone to have a fun and safe time!

### Sunday
Please join us for a casual breakfast on Sunday Morning at the Beaver Creek Club
Mountain Clubhouse (same place as the Friday Welcome Reception). Stop by anytime
between 9:00am and 11:30am for coffee, food, and/or a little hair of the dog.
Stay and chat or grab something to go. No RSVP necessary.

### Attire and Weather
We kindly request cocktail attire for the ceremony and reception. For the ladies, we also encourage you to bring a sweater or jacket to have in reserve.

Friday night dress is somewhat more casual than Saturday. Marla will be wearing
a white dress that is not her wedding dress and Jay will be wearing a dress shirt without a tie, if that helps.

No denim, athletic attire, or flip flops, please.

Summer weather in Coloradoâ€™s high country can be highly variable. In July, average daytime temperatures top out around 80 degrees and lows can approach 50 degrees. It's not uncommon for the temperature to drop 20 or more degrees once the sun goes down. While the venue is tented and heated, it is located outdoors and rain is possible anytime.

Fire danger in Eagle County (where all wedding festivities are taking place) is currently [Extreme](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/inyo/home/?cid=stelprdb5173311){:target="blank"} and it is presently illegal to smoke outside, including on balconies and porches. Please help us prevent fires! 

### Children
We look forward to letting loose with with our family and closest friends! While
we love your children, we regrettably are only able to accommodate adults at our
ceremony and reception. [Care 4 Kids](http://www.babysittinginvail.com/){:target="blank"} offers childcare options, and we would be thrilled to provide additional suggestions for childcare during the evening.

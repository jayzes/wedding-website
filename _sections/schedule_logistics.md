Please refer to our <a href="/#maps">maps</a> for directions, maps, and parking information for all of the weekend's festivities!

### Friday
Please join us Friday evening for a welcome reception at the Beaver Creek Club. Details may be found on the detail card in your invitation.

### Saturday
Our ceremony will take place at Red Sky Ranch Member Clubhouse on July 21. Cocktails, dinner and dancing will follow immediately at the same location.

Red Sky Ranch is located about 25 minutes (15 miles) west of Beaver Creek. We will provide transportation from convenient pickup points in Beaver Creek and Avon to Red Sky Ranch. Parking is also available at Red Sky should you wish to drive yourself; however, we do request that you take the shuttle if you are unfamiliar with mountain driving and/or if you wish to take advantage of the bar during the reception. We want everyone to have a fun and safe time!

Summer weather in Colorado’s high country can be highly variable. In July, average daytime temperatures top out around 80 degrees and lows can approach 50 degrees. While the venue is tented and heated, it is located outdoors and rain is possible anytime. Suggested attire is "mountain cocktail" - think cocktail, but with a sweater or jacket in reserve for cooler temperatures. No denim, athletic attire, or flip flops, please.

We look forward to letting loose with with our family and closest friends! While
we love your children, we regrettably are only able to accommodate adults at our
ceremony and reception. [Care 4 Kids](http://www.babysittinginvail.com/){:target="blank"} offers childcare options, and we would be thrilled to provide additional suggestions for childcare during the evening.

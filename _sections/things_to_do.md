The Vail Valley is a very special place for us - it’s where we had our first date, where we’ve spent many holidays, and where we got engaged. There are a ton of things to see and do in the summer all around the valley. A few of our favorites:

### Hiking and/or trail running
There are a ton of great trails within just a few minutes of Vail and Beaver Creek. On [Beaver Creek Mountain](https://assets.vailresorts.com/-/media/beaver-creek/products/brochure/the-mountain/about-the-mountain/trail-map/bc_summer-trail-map.ashx){:target="blank"}, the Overlook, Royal Elk, and Beaver Lake Trails offer terrific views, amazing wildflowers, and perhaps even wildlife. If you’re really lucky, you might even see a marmot or two - Marla’s favorite! You can choose to hike or run up from Beaver Creek Village, or catch a lift ride to the top and cut right to the downhill. On [Vail Mountain](https://www.vail.com/explore-the-resort/activities-and-events/summer-activities.aspx){:target="blank"}, Berry Picker, Kinnickinnick and Grand Traverse offer some great forested trails and an amazing 360-degree view of the wildflowers in Vail’s renowned bowls.

If you’re feeling particularly ambitious, the Vail Rec District’s [Half Marathon and 5K](http://www.vailrec.com/sports-activities/vail-race/trail-running-racing/vail-trail-run-camp-hale-half-marathon){:target="blank"} is Saturday morning at Camp Hale, a former US Army training facility for the 10th Mountain Division during World War II. 

### On the river
We’ve done an number of different river trips over the years, and always enjoy getting to spend time on the water. In order from least- to most-intense: In Avon proper, you can rent a paddleboard and go out on Nottingham Lake for a few laps in the shadow of the mountains. In State Bridge / Bond, you can float the Class II rapids of the upper Colorado River on a paddleboard (like we did the first time Marla came out to visit Jay!). Slightly further downstream, the Colorado River through Glenwood Canyon offers scenic views and Class II-IV rapids, either in river rafts or inflatable two-person kayaks called “duckies” (another favorite date!). 

### Golf
Red Sky Ranch is first and foremost a golf club and it offers two world-class
courses set among some truly stunning scenery. Beaver Creek resort also boasts a
golf course set in the shadow of the ski resort.

We'll have discounted options for both locations - if golf is your jam, check
back in the spring for details.

### Yoga
A favorite summer tradition for both of us is Vail’s free Saturday morning yoga classes on the “lawn” (turf on the skating rink) at Solaris. Starting at 9am, it’s a great way to unwind and enjoy the outdoors from the comfort of your mat.

### Coffee!
One of our favorite summer rituals is sitting outside reading while enjoying a delicious cold brew. Our two favorite spots in the valley are [Yeti’s Grind](https://www.yetisgrind.com/){:target="blank"} (located in the Solaris in Vail Village) and [Hovey & Harrison](https://hoveyandharrison.com/){:target="blank"} (located in Edwards). Hovey & Harrison also has a great brunch.

### Dining & Drinking
There are a number of dining and drinking establishments to suit nearly every preference. Some of our favorites, in no particular order, include:

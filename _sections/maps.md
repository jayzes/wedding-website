### Beaver Creek Shuttle Service
Free, on-demand shuttle service is available within the boundaries of Beaver Creek Resort. We recommend using Dial-A-Ride to get to the Welcome Reception and/or Wedding Shuttles if you are staying within Beaver Creek. Please call 970-949-1938 to request a ride. It can sometimes take up to 30 minutes to be picked up, so plan ahead!

[More information on Dial-A-Ride can be found here.](https://www.beavercreek.com/explore-the-resort/about-the-resort/getting-around.aspx?tc_1=2){:target="_blank"}

[More information on other intra-resort transit options can be found here.](https://www.beavercreek.com/explore-the-resort/about-the-resort/getting-around.aspx?tc_1=1){:target="_blank"}

### Parking
If you are not staying within Beaver Creek, you may park in the Ford Hall
garage, conveniently located a few steps away from both the Beaver Creek Club (Welcome Reception) and
Centennial Station (Wedding Shuttles).

You may also park at the Vilar Center garage. This location is also free and is
about a 10 minute walk to the Welcome Reception/Shuttles.

The guardhouse attendant can help direct you to either location. [More
information on parking can be found here.](https://www.beavercreek.com/explore-the-resort/about-the-resort/getting-around.aspx?tc_1=3){:target="_blank"}

Beaver Creek and Red Sky are both located at an elevation of over 8,000 feet above sea level. While we promise some truly amazing views (the sunsets at Red Sky are particularly legendary), if you’re traveling from a lower elevation there are some steps you can take to maximize your enjoyment.

Staying hydrated is the single most important step you can take to prevent altitude sickness. Be sure to drink plenty of water - moderately more than you’re used to drinking at home. We each like to carry around a water bottle that we can refill throughout the day.

You might also consider generally taking it easy the day you arrive to Colrado in order to help your body acclimate more quickly. Limiting alcohol and caffeine intake helps with that as well.

Finally, the summer sun in Colorado is no joke (Marla learned this one the hard way when she moved here). It’s a good idea to apply SPF 30+ sunscreen, even if you only plan to be outside for a few minutes.

Airbnb, VRBO, and East-West Vacation Rentals also have a number of great options. We strongly recommend staying somewhere within Beaver Creek itself or the Town of Avon so that you can easily catch the shuttle to the wedding and reception. If you are staying outside of Beaver Creek, please refer to the map on our website for information on where to park to catch the shuttle.

We do strongly suggest that you book your lodging as soon as possible. Beaver Creek is fast becoming a popular summer destination!

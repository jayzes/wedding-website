We both attended Northwestern University, though it wasn’t until 2012 that we met at a wedding of mutual friends. At the time, Marla lived in Chicago and Jay in Denver, so although there was instant chemistry, it took the better part of the following year for Jay to muster up the courage to invite Marla to visit Beaver Creek for a summer weekend. Over the ensuing months, the visits grew in frequency until we found ourselves in a fully long-distance relationship. In early 2014, Marla moved to Denver to escape Chicago’s notorious winters and to be closer to Jay. In 2015, we purchased our first home together in Denver and something else.

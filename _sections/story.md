We both attended Northwestern University, and though we've identified at least a handful of times where we crossed paths in school without realizing it, it wasn’t until 2012 that we actually officially met at a wedding of mutual friends. At the time, Marla lived in Chicago and Jay in Denver so although there was instant chemistry, it took the better part of the following year for Jay to muster up the courage to invite Marla to visit him in Beaver Creek for a summer weekend. Over the ensuing months, the visits grew in frequency until we found ourselves having "the talk" and embarking on a fully long-distance relationship. In early 2014, Marla moved to Denver to escape Chicago’s notorious winters and to be closer to Jay. In 2015, we moved again, this time into a home we purchased together in Denver.

Our life is filled with adventures of all kinds. We love going on exciting backcountry ski
trips and summer trail running expeditions, exploring Denver's vibrant restaurant scene,
learning how to garden in Colorado's desert climate, and browsing Bon Appetit
for hours on end in search of new recipes to try. We can't wait to share some of
  the things we love with you as we embark on our latest adventure as husband
  and wife.

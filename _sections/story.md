title: "Our Story"

We both attended Northwestern University, and though we've identified at least a handful of times where we crossed paths in school without realizing it, it wasn’t until 2012 that we actually officially met at a wedding of mutual friends. At the time, Marla lived in Chicago and Jay in Denver so although there was instant chemistry, it took the better part of the following year for Jay to muster up the courage to invite Marla to visit him in Beaver Creek for a summer weekend. Over the ensuing months, the visits grew in frequency until we found ourselves having "the talk" and embarking on a fully long-distance relationship. In early 2014, Marla moved to Denver to escape Chicago’s notorious winters and to be closer to Jay. In 2015, we moved again, this time into a home we purchased together in Denver.

Our life is filled with adventures of all kinds. We love going on exciting backcountry ski
trips and summer trail running expeditions, exploring Denver's vibrant restaurant scene,
learning how to garden in Colorado's desert climate, and browsing Bon Appetit
for hours on end in search of new recipes to try. We can't wait to share some of the things we love with you as we embark on our latest adventure as husband and wife.

### The Proposal
In October 2017, Jay suggested a weekend getaway to the mountains. We don’t normally venture up to the mountains during the “mud season,” but we were both in need of a mini vacation and were lured by the promise of early-season snowfall.

We ventured up to Piney Lake for a hike in the designated wilderness area. Jay noted a waterfall located a few miles up the mountain trail and we set off towards the peaks to find it. Marla chattered for most of the hike up about her winter running shoes and didn’t really notice Jay’s nerves.

When we reached our destination, we realized that the waterfall had already frozen over for the winter. As Marla looked around and began to comment on the scenery around them, Jay knelt on a rock outcropping overlooking the jagged Gore Range and asked Marla to be his forever adventure partner.
